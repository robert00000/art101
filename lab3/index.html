		<p>This document is about our past accomplishments in html and difficulties </p>
		<h3>Robert's summary of file structures </h3>
		<p>This lab is about file structures and building them in a sort of order to make sure that files are not disorganized as well as understanding how a html file can link to images and other files types it can pull from.</p>
		<h3>Challenges</h3>
		<p>In terms of coding I felt no real difficulties but finding time to work with a partner can sometimes be difficult due to scheduling or scheduling of classes. </p>
		<h3>Results</h3>
		<p>As a result we have created this site and another site using html and css as well as the differences in headings. </p>

		<h3>Results</h3>
