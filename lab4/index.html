	<h2>Lab4 - Pseudocoding and Problem solving </h2>
	<div id="challenges">
		<h2>Challenges </h2>
		<p>Robert's challenges: Coming up with a sort of pseudo problem by typing it down and making sure that it makes sense other than that I didn't find too many problems. </p>
		<p>Alexa's challenges: Interpretting the lab instructions for the JS and HTML tasks, as well as ensuring I followed the correct coding conventions.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="problems">
		<h2>Problems </h2>
		<p>Robert's summary: I didn't feel like we had a lot of problems with following the directions. </p>
		<p>Alexa's summary: There weren't any major hinderances I think that impeded our lab. We did do a lot of problem solving when pair coding, but that did not yield any problems as we were able communicate. </p>
	</div>
	<div id="results">
		<h2>Results </h2>
	<p>Felt like we understood the material and were able to follow the instructions clearly. The page you see here is the result with some css experimentation  </p>

 </a></li>
	<li><a>Task 3: Fix code for a program
Write some code that tries to solve a problem in the program
Look on the internet for a solution when you don't know where to look.
Incorporate a version of the solution that works for the program and is the same coding language.
Test out to see if code works and look for where problems arise such as syntax errors.
	1) Make sure the program and github works and is ready to be pushed into the main.
Github doesn't work because it isn't installed so install it
Does the editor you use have github? Copy and replace code into a new cloned folder without overwriting everything else that works.
Push and commit the program into the master branch.
Voila you are done.
	2) Program still doesn't work
Search up solutions for new errors online.
Try to mess around with the code to see if changes work.
Ask someone else to look at code.
They create a solution and the program works now.
 </a></li>
