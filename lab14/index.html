		<h2> Results</h2>
    <p>Messed around with debugging and experimented to see if there were any previous problems.
			I ended up improving one of my labs a little bit. <br> I decided to keep it simple since I just did lab 15 and I don't really have
		too much to add to this one. Tried implementing jQuery only to end up with a bit of a mess. </p>
